## Directory Details

### SR (Source Rules)
- Contains protocol identification rules and patterns
- Stores standardized detection patterns
- Serves as the foundation for rule-based identification
- Used as reference data for pattern matching

### cleaned_rfc
- Contains preprocessed RFC documents
- Documents are segmented into logical sections
- Structured format for easier analysis
- Facilitates efficient rule extraction
- Maintains document hierarchy and organization

### rfc
- Stores original RFC text documents
- Preserves raw document format
- Serves as source material
- Contains unmodified protocol specifications
- Reference for document integrity

### rule
- Contains final converted rules
- Stores standardized rule definitions
- Ready for system implementation
- Includes formatted rule specifications
- Used directly in protocol identification system
